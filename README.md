This is the repository for code and data from “Performance of rapid and conventional diagnostic tests for hepatitis E: insights from a field evaluation in Bentiu, South Sudan”. You will find R and STAN code needed to regenerate the primary analyses as well as all sensitivity analyses. If you have any questions, please log any issues in GitHub and we will reply as soon as possible. 


Latent class models are run using both R code (Public_code_latent_models.Rmd and Public_code_latent_outputs.Rmd) and STAN code (see below), while accelerated failure time models are run exclusively using R code (Public_code_AFT.Rmd).

STAN code corresponds to the following models:

The main analyses presented in the manuscript correspond to model m1_time.
